# Hackerrank-Solutions
In this repository I'm uploading the solutions of Hackerrank's 'Problem Solving' questions which I am solving everyday. I'm weekly updating this repository. 
All of the codes are in C programming language.
I am making these codes in the simplest possible way so that everyone can able to understand the code. 
If you want any code in Python, C++ or Javascipt then I can upload that also, just let me know about that.
The link for the question of each solution is inside the solution file.
